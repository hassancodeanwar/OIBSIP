## Iris Flower Classification

### Project Description

This Python script demonstrates a data science project for classifying Iris flowers into different species. It covers data loading, visualization, and the creation of a machine learning model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel.

### Key Steps

1. **Import Libraries**: Necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling are imported.

2. **Load Data**: The Iris dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and unnecessary columns are dropped.

3. **Data Visualization**: Various visualizations, including histograms, pair plots, pie charts, bar charts, and box plots, help understand the dataset's characteristics.

4. **Machine Learning Model**: Data is prepared for machine learning, including feature selection, encoding the target variable, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. A linear SVM classifier is trained.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The script calculates and prints the model's accuracy and generates a classification report to assess its performance.

6. **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is created and displayed as a heatmap to visualize model predictions.

### Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn).

2. Download the Iris dataset (CSV file) and update the file path in the script.

3. Run the script to perform data analysis, build the SVM model, and evaluate its accuracy.
